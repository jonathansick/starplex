Starplex
========

Starplex is a panchromatic star catalog engine developed for the ANDROIDS survey.
We're building Starplex to combine observations from multiple catalogs into a unified star catalog.
Starplex will also be capable of applying calibrations to photometry.

Setting up the database
-----------------------

Starplex requires a working PostgreSQL database.
On a Mac, the best way to get this is with `Postgres.app <http://postgresapp.com>`_.
Running this will create a user corresponding to your login account name.
Login to the default database using ``psql`` and prepare a new one for Starplex::

   create database starplex;
   \connect starplex;
   create extension postgis;
   create extension hstore;


To install Starplex dependencies, run::

   pip install -r requirements.txt

To install the python Starplex package itself, run::

   python setup.py install

Running Tests
-------------

Create a test database named ``starplex_test`` using the same procedure as above.
As before create postgis and hstore extensions.

Then run tests via::

   python setup.py test

Note: This assumes the user is named ``jsick``.
Obviously we'll need to get this fixed.

Schema Overview
---------------

Starplex sets up tables in three categories: supporting tables, observational tables, and reduced catalog tables.

The only supporting table right now is ``bandpass``, which provides a definition of a bandpass name and photometric system.

Observationally oriented tables provide storage of raw photometric catalogs, such as those made by DOLPHOT.

- ``catalog`` defines an observation catalog, such as a run of dolphot.
- ``catalog_star`` defines stars observed in a ``catalog``.
- ``observation`` defines a photometric observation, in a single bandpass for a ``catalog_star``.

Reduced catalogs are stored across two tables:

- ``star`` defines a unique star
- ``magnitude`` defines a photometric quality of a single star in a single bandpass.

Browse the ``starplex/database`` directory to see how the models are constructed.

Useful Indices
--------------

It's up to the user to setup indices (aside from primary key indices that Postgres creates).
It is useful to make indices on foreign keys::

    CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_fk_bandpass_id on observation USING btree (bandpass_id);
    CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_fk_catalog_star_id on observation USING btree (catalog_star_id);
    CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_fk_catalog_id on catalog_star USING btree (catalog_id);
    CREATE INDEX idx_bandpass_name ON bandpass (name);
    CREATE INDEX idx_bandpass_system ON bandpass (system);
    CREATE INDEX idx_catalog_name ON catalog (name);
    CREATE INDEX idx_catalog_instrument ON catalog (instrument);

Be sure to run ANALYZE on each table after creating an index.
Keep in mind that you'll want to drop these indices when ingesting large data sets using ``DROP INDEX idx_name``.

Depending on the application, you may also want to index on the `meta` columns. The general pattern for this is::

    CREATE INDEX ON publishers((info->>'name'));

Connecting to a Session
-----------------------

The most way to get an SQLAlchemy session, and hence begin with the database, is with the ``connect`` function:

.. code:: python

    from starplex.database import connect, Session, create_all
    connect(user="starplex", name="starplex", host="localhost", port=5432, echo=True)
    session = Session()
    create_all()

Note that ``echo`` is an extra keyword passed to the SQLAlchemy engine.

Sometimes it's easier to maintain database connection info in a configuration file.
This can be done by creating a ``~/.starplex.json`` file with a format similar to:

.. code:: javascript

   {"servers":
       {"marvin": {"host": "localhost",
                   "port": 25432,
                   "user": "starplex",
                   "name": "starplex"
                   }
       }
   }

Here we've named a server call ``marvin``.
Now we can connect to a named server with:

.. code:: python

   from starplex.database import connect_to_server, Session, create_all
   connect_to_server("marvin", echo=True)
   session = Session()
   create_all()
    
Ingesting the 2MASS Point Source Catalog
----------------------------------------

One thing you can do is ingest a portion of the 2MASS PSC.
First, download the PSC files (compressed as ``.gz``) from ``ftp.ipac.caltech.edu``.
Starplex includes a ``starplex_twomicron.py`` script to ingest an arbitrary portion of this.
For example, to ingest 2MASS stars around M31, run::

   starplex_twomicron.py /data/2mass_psc --ra 7.5 17 --dec 36 47

(where the directory points to your PSC files).
This tool generates a catalog named ``2MASS_PSC`` in the ``catalog`` table, along with related catalog stars and observations.

Examples
--------

Querying an Observational Catalog to get a NumPy Structured Array
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose you've loaded an HST/ACS star catalog named ``'disk'`` with photometry in filters named ``'f606w'`` and ``'f814w'``.
We'd like to retrieve this observational catalog into a structured numpy array of stellar RA, Dec, completeness fraction, and magnitudes in F606W and F814W.
This can be accomplished with the following script:

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    from sqlalchemy.orm import aliased
    from starplex.database import connect_to_server, Session
    from starplex.database import Catalog, Bandpass, CatalogStar, Observation

    connect_to_server('marvin', echo=True)
    session = Session()
    mag606obs = aliased(Observation)
    mag814obs = aliased(Observation)
    bp606 = aliased(Bandpass)
    bp814 = aliased(Bandpass)
    fieldname = "disk"
    q = session.query(CatalogStar.ra, CatalogStar.dec,
                      CatalogStar.cfrac, mag606obs.mag, mag814obs.mag)\
            .join(mag606obs, CatalogStar.observations)\
            .join(mag814obs, CatalogStar.observations)\
            .join(Catalog)\
            .filter(Catalog.name == fieldname)\
            .join(bp606, mag606obs.bandpass)\
            .filter(bp606.name == "f606w")\
            .join(bp814, mag814obs.bandpass)\
            .filter(bp814.name == "f814w")
    dt = [('ra', np.float), ('dec', np.float), ('cfrac', np.float),
        ('m606', np.float), ('m814', np.float)]
    data = np.array(q.all(), dtype=np.dtype(dt))
    session.close()
    print data

A lot of the query magic here revolves around grabbing two rows from the ``Observation`` table corresponding to the F606W and F814W magnitudes of stars.
Since we need to join to the ``Observation`` and ``Bandpass`` tables twice, we create aliases to declare when we're talking to those tables in the context of either the F606W or F814W bandpasses.

Finding Catalogs Containing a Coordinate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose you want to know what observational catalogs cover a coordinate.
The ``catalog`` table has a ``footprint`` column that lets us easily perform coverage queries.

.. code:: python

    from starplex.database import connect_to_server, Session
    from starplex.database import Catalog, Bandpass, CatalogStar, Observation
    from starplex.database.meta import point_str

    connect_to_server('marvin', echo=True)
    session = Session()

    # define a coordinate to test catalog coverage
    coord = SkyCoord(10.38891666667 * u.deg, 40.0101944444 * u.deg)
    # convert the coordinate to a WKT form for PostGIS
    point = point_str(coord.ra.deg, coord.dec.deg)

    # Use the ST_Intersects to use to coverage testing for geography
    # data types.
    q = session.query(Catalog)\
        .filter(func.ST_Intersects(
            func.Geometry(Catalog.footprint),
            func.Geometry(func.ST_GeographyFromText(point))))
    for c in q:
        print c.name

    session.close()
